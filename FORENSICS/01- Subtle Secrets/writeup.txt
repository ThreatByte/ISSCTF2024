After running exiftool, there is few data which can be found suspicious for e.g. Key:3 Mode:ECE, Signature: Rijndael, Secret code: TheBestEspionage

Extract the flag from the png file using any tool you've found. Here i have used stegosuite, which asks for a key to extract the text 

stegosuite gui or stegosuite extract -k key filename

Then try to check if there is any zipped file in the png file. Use binwalk, Unzip or any other toools you find useful.

unzip The-Best-Espionage.png

After extracting the zipped file, there is a new directory called The-Best-Espionage and it has a few directories of Short Stories about the acts of Espionage. 

After viewing the directories, each has a text file which contains the short story. After viewing the text file, there was no plain sight of data. After using a tool called stegsnow which hides the text in tabs and whitespaces we found a base64 data in Black Box and Hex data in The Assisstant Producer

After running the command stegsnow -C filename 

We get a base64 data : /ZIxQHu434W1D95VKKlKQA== 
We get a hex data: fd9231407bb8df85b50fde5528a94a40

In the metadata the signature name is mentionted as Rijndael which was the original name for AES encryption algorithm.

This data was encoded using a cryptoalgorithm called AES encryption and from the metadata we know the secret key is TheBestEspionage and the enumerate mode is ECE.

After using a online decoder we get the password or key for the file which is 007

Next use the tool stegosuite to extract the text and we get the flag: EspionageCTF{1MInT_i5_R3@l1y_pU2zL1nG} ImageIntelligence is really puzzling
