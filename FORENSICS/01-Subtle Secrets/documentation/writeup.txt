Run Exiftool, the metadata doesn't seem to have any hints or any other data related to the flag.
Run Strings The-Best-Espionage.png > folder named Secret can be seen
unzip The-Best-Espionage.png
You'll see a directory called Secrets, navigate  to the Secrets directory
cd Secrets
After navigating to the directory, there are 3 directories with different short stories
Run stegsnow -C without the pass on all the folders. Finally, the Black Box directory has some encoded data.
cd Black Box
stegsnow -C Black Box.txt > output the AES encoded part of the flag

To find the Key for the decryption, look at pdf

pdftotext key.pdf key.txt

cat key.txt > The title is The Secret 
               TheBestEspionage

So now we have the AES 128-bit secret key to decode the AES-encoded text which is TheBestEspionage

From there use an AES decoder and you'll get the first half of the flag >  EspionageCTF{1MInT_i

To get the second half, as the 2nd hint suggests,  use stegosuite and use the first half of the flag as the password. 

You'll get the rest of the flag which is EspionageCTF{1MInT_i5_R3@l1y_pU2zL1nG}
