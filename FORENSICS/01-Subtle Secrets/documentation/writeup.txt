unzip The-Best-Espionage.png
cd Secrets
cd Black Box
stegsnow -C Black Box.txt > output the AES encoded part of the flag

To find the Key for the decryption, look at pdf

pdftotext key.pdf key.txt

cat key.txt > The title is the Secret 
              TheBestEspionage

From there use an AES decoder and you'll get the first half of the flag >  EspionageCTF{1MInT_i

To get the second half, use stegosuite and use the first half of the flag as the password.

You'll get the rest of the flag which is EspionageCTF{1MInT_i5_R3@l1y_pU2zL1nG}
