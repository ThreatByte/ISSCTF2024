After running ExifTool, there are few data that can be found suspicious e.g. Signature: Rijndael, Secret code: TheBestEspionage

Extract the flag from the png file using any tool you've found. Here I have used stegosuite, which asks for a key to extract the text 

stegosuite gui or stegosuite extract -k key filename

Then try to check if there is any zipped file in the png file. Use Binwalk, Unzip, or any other tools you find helpful.

unzip The-Best-Espionage.png

After extracting the zipped file, there is a new directory called The-Best-Espionage and it has a few directories of Short Stories about the acts of Espionage. 

After viewing the directories, each has a text file that contains a short story. After viewing the text file, there was no plain sight of the data. After using a tool called stegsnow which hides the text in tabs and whitespaces we found base64 data in Black Box and Hex data in The Assistant Producer

After running the command stegsnow -C filename, we get some base64 data.
In the metadata, the signature name is mentioned as Rijndael which is the original name for AES encryption algorithm.

This data was encoded using a crypto algorithm called AES encryption and from the metadata, we know the secret key is TheBestEspionage and the enumerate mode is ECE.

After using an online decoder we get half the flag which is EspionageCTF{1MInT_i which is also the password for extracting the rest of the flag.

Next, use the tool stegosuite to extract the text and we get the flag: EspionageCTF{1MInT_i5_R3@l1y_pU2zL1nG} (ImageIntelligence is really puzzling)
