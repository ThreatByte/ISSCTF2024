From the code, we can see that each function calls the function transmit(), which has base64 encoded data. Only four or five Functions have what is necessary 
for the flag (from the instructions), and the other functions are just dummy. From the hint, we can assume that the base64 has been encoded multiple times randomly.
So one way is to decode the base64 data Multiple times for each function and see if there is any word that can be linked to the flag or we can decode the whole 
base64 code that we get upon calling all Functions in the main program and looking for the words that may be the flag for each iteration.
