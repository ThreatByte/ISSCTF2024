**Challenge Title: Decoy Flag Extraction**

**Challenge Description:**
Welcome to the Decoy Flag Extraction challenge! Your goal is to craft a highly precise regular expression to extract a specific flag pattern from a text. The flag format is `EspionageCTF{}` with a random text inside the curly braces when you create the Correct Regex it will show the Flag along with the text inside the curly braces giving you the flag.
However, there's a twist â€“ numerous decoy flags with various characters, numbers, and symbols have been scattered throughout the text, making the task more challenging. 
Create a regular expression that can accurately isolate the genuine flag while disregarding the decoys.



**Note to Participants:**
This challenge challenges your knowledge of regular expressions. Your objective is to design a regular expression pattern capable of recognizing and extracting the hidden flag, `EspionageCTF{xyz}`, from a mixed set of flags in the provided text. Success hinges on your ability to carefully tailor the expression to ignore false positives. 
Best of luck!
