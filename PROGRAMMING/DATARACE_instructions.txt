As an elite intelligence agent, you've discovered that a rogue enemy organization has intercepted sensitive communications between government agencies. To prevent the enemy from decrypting the messages and jeopardizing national security, you must access their decryption program and acquire the secret decryption key.


Your mission is to exploit a data race condition in the enemy's decryption program to retrieve the decryption key. The decryption process is multi-threaded, allowing concurrent threads to decrypt the message. However, due to improper synchronization, a data race condition exists that can be exploited to intercept the decryption key before the threads synchronize and finalize the decryption process.
