There is 2 services which run for this challenge.

One is using port 3000, this is the react app which is a front end.
Another is using port 3721, this is a node.js express app which is the API.

Solution:
1. View the source code of the react app
2. See API.js file. This contains a commented out DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY which is used to make requests.
3. Make POST requests to each of the API endpoints, one contains a quote from the hackers movie for most commonly used passwords as a hint...
4. The /internal endpoint gives an error if using the normal PRODUCTION_API_KEY, use the DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY.
5. Error saying "password" parameter is missing. Either can be found by bruteforcing or watching the damn 5 second video... Correct password is "god"
