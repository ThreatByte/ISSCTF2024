Hello i need your help! I have this odd file extension on my desktop it ends with ".kanti".
Can you tell me some IOCs of this file extension. I want to known the following:

How many file extensions were excluded?
What is the programming language that the malware is written in?
What is the parent process name of the child process(1488)?
