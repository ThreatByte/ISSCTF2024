I'm trying to do some threat intelligence. Based on the photo you will need to lookup what is the name of the threat actor and look at additional blog post.
The flag is the following:
1. Let me know what Regions were targeted 
2. What is the first technique id under impact
3. What sysinternals tool is used for privilege escalation.
