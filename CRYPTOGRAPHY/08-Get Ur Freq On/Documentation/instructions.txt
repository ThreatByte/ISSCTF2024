We've obtained a bunch of leaked passwords belonging to the target's employees, the problem is they're all encrypted with some sort of substitution cipher. 

I've attached an encrypted password belonging to one of their higher ups I want you to decrypt. I've also included the other encrypted passwords, maybe you can figure out a pattern or something?
