We've obtained a bunch of leaked passwords belonging to the target's employees, the problem is they're all encrypted with some sort of substitution cipher. 

Do you think you can have a crack at it? I've attached an encrypted password belonging to one of their higher ups I want you to decrypt. I've also included the other encrypted passwords, maybe you can figure out a pattern or something?
