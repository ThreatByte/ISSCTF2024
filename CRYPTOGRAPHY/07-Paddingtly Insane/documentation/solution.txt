The program does not actually authenticate the user, the competitor just needs to provide valid padding to get the flag.

The simplest way is finding a valid string with a padding of 0x01 as the last character.

User would need to bruteforce the program locally to find the valid combination of characters with something like exploit.py and then use the combination to get the flag.
