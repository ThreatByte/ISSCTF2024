Mission Briefing: "Operation Audio Intercept - Decrypt the One-Time Pad Cipher!"

Operation Audio Intercept is a critical mission that requires your exceptional cryptanalysis skills. A covert operative intercepted an enigmatic audio file from a rogue agent's shortwave radio transmission. The audio file holds the key to unlocking an encrypted message secured with the impenetrable One-Time Pad Cipher. 

Your first task is to meticulously analyze the audio file, as it contains a series of Morse code signals. Your mission objective is to translate the Morse code into text, extracting the hidden key necessary to decrypt the classified message.

Once you have successfully deciphered the Morse code and obtained the secret key, the real challenge begins. Utilizing the key, you must employ modulo 26 arithmetic to reverse-engineer the encryption process on this list of numbers that we found in a rougue agents note book Encrypted msg = [2, 8, 2, 25, 23, 7, 4, 9, 10, 2]. This will unveil the concealed plaintext message, revealing critical intelligence that could change the course of the operation.

Remember, the One-Time Pad Cipher's strength lies in the absolute secrecy of the key. The rogue agent must have used a truly random key of the same length as the message, making the encryption unbreakable when used correctly.
