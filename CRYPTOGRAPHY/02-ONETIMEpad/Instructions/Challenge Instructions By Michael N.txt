Challenge Instructions: By Michael N 


The objective of this challenge is to decrypt a secret message that has been encrypted using the One-Time Pad Cipher with some other arithmetic. The plaintext message has been encrypted using a secret key, and the resulting ciphertext has been converted to numeric indices corresponding to the letters in the English alphabet.

Good news! We managed to snag the key while it was being sent by a rogue agent. You've got it now to help crack this challenge.

Keep in mind that the key used for encryption should only be used once to maintain the security of the One-Time Pad.
