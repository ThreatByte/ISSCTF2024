Challenge Instructions: By Michael N 


The objective of this challenge is to decrypt a secret message that has been encrypted using the One-Time Pad Cipher with modulo 26 arithmetic. The plaintext message has been encrypted using a secret key, and the resulting ciphertext has been converted to numeric indices corresponding to the letters in the English alphabet.

The participants will be provided with the following information:

The encrypted message: A sequence of numeric indices representing the ciphertext.
The secret key: Another sequence of numeric indices, which should be used to decrypt the message.
The encryption process uses a simple formula: ENCRYPT = (MESSAGE + KEY) MOD 26, where each element of the encrypted message is obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the plaintext message and the secret key, and then taking the modulo 26 of the result.

Participants will need to reverse the encryption process to decrypt the message and reveal the hidden plaintext. Keep in mind that the key used for encryption should only be used once to maintain the security of the One-Time Pad.
